The topological sort of the first graph is:
VERTEX	NUMBER
A		1
B		2
E		3
D		4
C		5
G		6
F		7


For the second graph:
Shortest paths for the first vertex:

Shortest path from A to A Distance: 0 (A -> A)
Shortest path from A to B Distance: 2 (A -> B)
Shortest path from A to C Distance: 3 (A -> D-> C)
Shortest path from A to D Distance: 1 (A -> D)
Shortest path from A to E Distance: 3 (A -> D-> E)
Shortest path from A to F Distance: 6 (A -> D-> G-> F)
Shortest path from A to G Distance: 5 (A -> D-> G)


The edges in the minimum spanning tree for the third graph are:
(G, F, 1)
(A, D, 1)
(D, C, 2)
